# Graph Processing Benchmark Framework (GPBF)

## Description
This is the code for my Graph Processing Benchmark Framework (GPBF) Bachelors' Thesis. It is a benchmarking program for various graph processing algorithms using different graph-representing data structures. The algorithms implemented are DFS, BFS, and PageRank, in both edge-centric and vertex-centric versions.

## Datasets
The datasets used are taken from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP).

## Usage 
```python
python main.py

The dataset willing to be used and the graph type(directed/undirected) can be changed in the main program.
