# Graph Processing Benchmark Framework (GPBF)

## Description
This is the code for my Graph Processing Benchmark Framework (GPBF) Bachelor's Thesis. It is a benchmarking program for various graph processing algorithms using different graph-representing data structures. The algorithms implemented are DFS, BFS, and PageRank, in both edge and vertex-centric versions.

After running the code, respectively, the number of nodes in a dataset, the name of the file used, the type of the graph(directed/undirected), the loading time, and the runtimes of all the methods will be printed.

## Datasets
The datasets used are taken from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP) and Koblenz Network Collection.

The dataset that is willing to be used and the graph type(directed/undirected) can be changed in the main program.

## Usage 
```python
python main.py
